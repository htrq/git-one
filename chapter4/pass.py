# pass does nothing it used when program does nothing but sintactically any statement needed
# example 1 below:
while(true):
    pass

# example 2 below:
class noActionClass:
    pass

# example 3, when you need abstract function but not to realizing right now
# so here can be used pass statement for a while as a place-holder

def abstractFunc():
    pass
